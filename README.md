This is my website Named Local Chef Bazaar, which is built using React and tailwind and daisy ui. It is a single-page application that allows users to view and interact with a collection of images.

The website is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, with a clean and modern interface. It uses React components to create a modular and reusable codebase, and react router to handle server-side rendering and routing.

I use React hook form manage all form and use tanstack quary and axios for fatchaing data from server.
